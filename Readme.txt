This package does not depend on external tools, save for the MATLAB Machine Learning,
Fuzzy Sets, and Statistics Toolboxes. Have a look at the comments at the beginning of
MyClust6.m for info on how to perform image segmentation. The files MyClustEvalRGB.m
and MyClustEvalHyper.m define functions which compute the Object Consistency Error
between two segmentations. Those files also have comments at the beginning detailing
their calling conventions.
